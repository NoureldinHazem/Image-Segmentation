Problem Statement:</br>
We intend to perform image segmentation. Image segmentation means that we can group
similar pixels together and give these grouped pixels the same label. The grouping
problem is a clustering problem. We want to study the use of K-means on the Berkeley
Segmentation Benchmark.</br></br>
Steps done in this Assignment:
1. Download the dataset and understand the format
2. Visualize the image and the ground truth segmentation
3. Segmentation using K-means
4. Big Picture (normalized cut)</br></br>
